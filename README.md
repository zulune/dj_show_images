# Django Project Deployment

This guide will walk you through the steps to deploy a Django project using Docker.

## Requirements

- Docker
- Docker Compose

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd <project-directory>
    ```

3. Build and run the Docker containers:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```

4. Access the Django application in your web browser at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

## Project Structure

The project structure should look like this:


- `.venv`: Virtual environment folder (for local development).
- `src/`: Django project folder.
- `manage.py`: Django management script.
- `car_detect/`: Your Django application folder.
- `Dockerfile`: Configuration file for building the Docker image.
- `docker-compose.yaml`: Configuration file for Docker Compose.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies.

## Customize Settings

Make sure to customize the Django settings (`src/car_detect/settings.py`) for your specific project needs, including database configuration, static files, and security settings.
